## My process

Content first approach meaning I branched out the HTML then applied the Styling, I tried to get it as close as possible and I believe I did bar a few spacing changes and font-size changes

### Built with

HTML5, CSS3 and patience

### What I learned

This is so far similar to the previous challenges we've had from FEM but still helpful.
